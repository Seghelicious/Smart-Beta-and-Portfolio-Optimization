# Smart-Beta-and-Portfolio-Optimization

This is the third project of the AI for Trading Nanodegree.

In this project, 
- I have built a smart beta portfolio and compared it to a benchmark index. 
- I have calculated the tracking error against the index to evaluate the performance of the smart beta portfolio.
- I have also built a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights. 
- I rebalanced the portfolio and calculated the turnover to evaluate the performance. 
- I have used this metric to find the optimal rebalancing Frequency. 
- For the dataset, the end of day data from Quotemedia is used.
